    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>This recipe is inspired by the Nepalese momos which are available at literally every corner in India. But these are also called dimsums in other
         Asian countries. Almost the same thing!</p>
    <h5>Ingridients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 lbs of chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onions </li>
        <li>8 tablespoons minced garlic and ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinamon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the flour and 1 1/2 cups room temperature water in a bowl. Knead the dough well until it is medium-firm and flexible. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the chicken, cilantro, onions, garlic, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>To make the wrappers: Break off 1/2 ounce of dough and forming it into a ball. Place the ball on a flat surface and roll it into a 4-inch round with
             a rolling pin. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Spray a steamer pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place a tablespoon of the chicken filling in the middle of a wrapper. Holding the wrapper in your left hand. Use your right thumb and index finger to
             start pinching the edges of the wrapper together. Pinch and fold until the edges of the circle close up like a little satchel. Place the momo in the prepared 
             steamer pan. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
        </li>
        <li>Fill the steamer pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Set the steamer pan with the momos on top of the pot and cover with a tight lid. Steam the momos until
             cooked, 8 to 9 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
